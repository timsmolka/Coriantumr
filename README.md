# 🛰️ Science Maps

A GPS navigation app that works like Google Maps, but shows every distance and
speed in **scientific units** — light-milliseconds, astronomical units, Mach
numbers, percent of light speed, and more — with a familiar unit shown
underneath for reference.

It also pulls **live weather** to compute the real local **speed of sound**, so
the Mach numbers reflect the actual air around you.

```
Distance:  2.4 light-ms   Speed:  Mach 0.092
           (447 mi)               (70 mph)
```

## How to run it

The app is a plain static website that uses native ES modules. Browsers block
ES modules on `file://`, so you need to open it over `http://`. A tiny
dependency-free server (`serve.ps1`) is included for Windows.

1. Open **PowerShell** in this folder (`science-maps`).
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File serve.ps1
   ```
3. Open the printed URL in your browser: **http://localhost:8137/**
4. Press **Ctrl+C** in PowerShell to stop the server.

> Want a different port? `... -File serve.ps1 -Port 9000`

If you have Python or Node installed, those work too:
`python -m http.server 8137` or `npx serve`.

### Using it
- Click **📍 Use my location** (allow the location prompt) to set your start.
- **Search** for a place, or **click the map** to drop a destination.
- A route appears with distance, time, and turn-by-turn directions.
- Pick your primary **distance/speed units**, or flip on **Smart unit mode** to
  let the app choose the most readable scientific unit automatically.
- **Start tracking** reads your live GPS speed (best on a phone, on the move).

> Location and live-speed tracking need a secure context — they work on
> `http://localhost` and on `https://` sites, but not from a `file://` page.

## How the code is organized

Everything is vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no build step, no frameworks.

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | Page structure (the skeleton). |
| `css/style.css` | All the styling, responsive layout, dark "space" header. |
| `js/distance.js` | **Distance engine** — converts meters ↔ 15 units (mm … light-years). |
| `js/speed.js` | **Speed engine** — converts m/s ↔ 8 units (mph … %c, Mach). |
| `js/atmosphere.js` | **Physics** — local speed of sound from temperature/humidity/pressure. |
| `js/units.js` | **Smart mode** — picks the most readable unit for any scale. |
| `js/facts.js` | Astronomy/physics "Did you know?" facts chosen by scale. |
| `js/services.js` | Network calls: search, routing, and weather. |
| `js/app.js` | The UI brain — wires the map + controls to the engines. |
| `serve.ps1` | Tiny local dev server (so ES modules load over http). |

The golden rule in `app.js`: **actions change `state`, then call `render()`**.
`render()` only reads state and redraws — never the other way around. That
one-way flow keeps things predictable.

## Data sources (all free, no API keys)

- **Map & tiles:** [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) + [CARTO Voyager](https://carto.com/basemaps/) basemap (built on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data) — a clean, Google-Maps-like style
- **Search (geocoding):** [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/)
- **Routing & turn-by-turn:** [OSRM](https://project-osrm.org/) public demo (car routing only)
- **Weather:** [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) — keyless, used for the speed-of-sound math

> The project brief suggested OpenWeatherMap; Open-Meteo was used instead because
> it needs no API key, which keeps the app fully runnable out of the box.

## What's done vs. the roadmap

Done: distance engine, speed engine, local speed-of-sound, live weather, web
interface, interactive map, routing with turn-by-turn, and the scientific
dashboards (atmosphere, multi-unit tables, light/sound travel time, facts).

Future phase: packaging as a mobile app (React Native / Expo), and live traffic.

## Accuracy notes

- Distance conversions use **exact** definitions (1 mi = 1609.344 m, c =
  299,792,458 m/s, 1 AU = 149,597,870,700 m, 1 ly = c × 31,557,600 s).
- Speed of sound uses the ideal-gas formula `c = √(γRT/M)` with a humid-air
  correction (water vapor lowers the average molar mass, so humid air carries
  sound slightly faster). Falls back to the dry-air approximation, then to the
  ISA sea-level value (340.29 m/s), if inputs are missing.
